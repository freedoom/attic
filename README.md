# Freedoom Attic

Since starting in 2001, [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io) has changed a lot since its inception, and the Attic is proof of this, as it contains resources previously submitted to Freedoom, but have since been replaced or were _never_ used in the first place due to a number of wild reasons, such as being outdated, not up to snuff, not a vanilla map, only test levels, etc - despite this, the many people behind Freedoom are grateful for the work of others who have made content for the game, even if it is no longer used.

Be aware that, unlike now, Freedoom was not always meant to be a vanilla-only set of IWADs, meaning that to play some of the WADs here, an advanced Doom source port, such as [QZDoom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/QZDoom), [PrBoom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PrBoom), [Pooch](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Pooch) or any other port that is [Boom-compatible](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Boom_compatible) may be needed.

As with most things relating to Freedoom, all of the contents in this git [use the same license](https://freedoom.github.io/about.html) as the main Freedoom project.

If you're still interested in Freedoom history and want to play some _really_ old versions of it, we have a [whole historic repository on here for you to enjoy](https://github.com/freedoom/historic) - lots of old maps that you can blast your way through.

Happy fraggin'!
