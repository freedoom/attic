E1TEXT = As the last brute falls to the ground,\n\
         you only now notice how much your whole\n\
         body is quivering. Just what the hell are\n\
         those things? Aliens? Did AGM really make\n\
         first contact and hide it from the world?\n\
         Well, whatever it is they did, it bit them\n\
         in the ass hard. There's not a single human\n\
         left alive on this whole rock - and no\n\
         spaceships to take you home, either.\n\
         You step onto one of those stupid\n\
         AGM teleport pads that give you nausea,\n\
         and arrive at the facility where they first\n\
         brought you. The place is already in ruins,\n\
         ancient-looking alien marble peering from\n\
         the cracks. Ruins built upon ruins.\n\
         Whatever - the spaceport better still be\n\
         there, you're in no mood for more detours!
E2TEXT = Now that these monstrosities are dead\n\
         and done with, this whole place is yours\n\
         for the taking - including a shiny new\n\
         spaceship, and access to AGM data logs!\n\
         And who would've guessed - these bastards\n\
         really did make first contact, 10 years ago,\n\
         and decided to privatize it. They dug up\n\
         the ruins and found the alien bugs, which\n\
         they've since bred for genetics and combat\n\
         research. They also stole their teleport\n\
         pad technology. But then they found those\n\
         bird-faced bruisers a month ago. These guys\n\
         somehow remotely hijacked the portals to\n\
         route to the Horizon star system, which is\n\
         where the invasion force is coming from.\n\
         Your instincts are clear - Earth can wait,\n\
         someone's got to clean up this mess ASAP!
E3TEXT = Before you reached Horizon, you thought\n\
         maybe the aliens could be reasoned with.\n\
         But then you saw humans being tortured for\n\
         sport. Or half-eaten while still alive.\n\
         And slaves, thousands of slaves worked\n\
         to death building their bizarre temples.\n\
         No, these guys are not the victims here.\n\
         Hard to believe, but they're worse than AGM!\n\
         Well, at least it's over now - the thing you\n\
         just killed was some sort of psychic beacon\n\
         homed in on AGM's colony. As the hijacked\n\
         portals slowly lose target, you make your\n\
         way back. Thinking of Earth the entire time.\n\
         Your ship's non-precise warp travel might\n\
         force a pit-stop at Saturn's Double Impact\n\
         moon base, but it's no problem, right?\n\
         Surely they'll welcome you with open arms!
E4TEXT = Well, this is not good at all.\n\
         If Double Impact was overrun, it means\n\
         the aliens have found our solar system.\n\
         You try to contact Earth, but to no avail.\n\
         As you try to calm yourself by blaming\n\
         the damaged equipment, something else\n\
         catches your attention - an AGM digital\n\
         wanted poster, featuring your own face!\n\
         They're still after you, after all this?\n\
         You smash the console in anger and leave.\n\
         Between AGM and the aliens, you're just\n\
         completely done with space at this point.\n\
         Your DNA is all scrambled up, you might\n\
         have alien genes inside you even,\n\
         but you don't even care anymore - let's\n\
         just go home, and look for a quiet life.\n\
         A quiet life, and freedom.

# After MAP06, before MAP07:
C1TEXT = This is certainly not how you were hoping\n\
         your return to Earth would look like. Ever\n\
         since landing in this complex it's been a\n\
         non-stop deja vu of aliens and zombified\n\
         AGM soldiers - and not a single person to\n\
         talk to, either... At least you've had a lot\n\
         of time for some light reading on AGM logs.\n\
         You're already wanted for knowing too much,\n\
         so why not? There's concerningly little on\n\
         what's happening to the world, and the last\n\
         entry from two days ago just reads\n\
         "The eye it raised the dead" over and over.\n\
         Huh. You take a deep breath, curse AGM\n\
         once again for starting this, and continue\n\
         to the research sector. Saving the world?\n\
         You never signed up for this. But so be it -\n\
         Earth is your home, aliens better beware!
# After MAP11, before MAP12:
C2TEXT = Entering the conquered facility's comms\n\
         center, you attempt to contact the world.\n\
         "This is the resistance, do you copy?"\n\
         - you're overjoyed to finally hear!\n\
         You then get to hear all the latest news.\n\
         All major AGM teleporters are hijacked,\n\
         world's military is losing ground, AGM has\n\
         holed up on the moon and isn't helping...\n\
         "So where's the nearest major teleporter?"\n\
         You're directed to a nearby city. They ask\n\
         who exactly you are, but you cut the comms.\n\
         As you arrive in the city you realize you\n\
         forgot to ask for precise coords - but...\n\
         That won't be necessary. An alien fortress\n\
         now looms among the skyline, in the place\n\
         where AGM's headquarters used to stand.\n\
         All right, then - that's the destination!
# After MAP20, before MAP21:
C3TEXT = As you stand before the gate to the alien\n\
         homeworld, you get startled by AGM copters\n\
         approaching. Thankfully their logos are\n\
         crossed out - must be the resistance.\n\
         With your back now secured, you step into\n\
         the portal, and end up... in a black void.\n\
         You sense being watched. Then suddenly, you\n\
         feel overwhelming power before you as a\n\
         titanic skull-thing appears in the void.\n\
         "Who are you to deny the sacred empire?"\n\
         - you hear inside your mind. "The fate of\n\
         your kind is sealed. Accept this and die..."\n\
         The last word reverberates through your\n\
         body as you wake up in a sweat, on the other\n\
         side of the portal. Was that... a god? You\n\
         might be completely out of your league here.\n\
         But it is too late to turn back now...
# After MAP30 (endgame text):
C4TEXT = The moment before entering this chamber\n\
         was perhaps the greatest fear you've ever\n\
         felt in your life. After all, can a god even\n\
         be killed? But this thing was no god.\n\
         It could be killed. And it has been.\n\
         And, uh, it's about to explode now. Wasting\n\
         no time, you commandeer an alien spaceship\n\
         and lift off, just in time to see the blast\n\
         take out a sizable chunk of the planet!!\n\
         Now that'll put a dent in their plans...\n\n\
         Back on Earth, as the panicked aliens are\n\
         being dealt with, you at long last doff\n\
         your armor, and disappear into the crowds.\n\
         No one will know who saved them.\n\
         No one will ever find you again.\n\
         You are free.
# Before MAP31 (secret level #1):
C5TEXT = Well, this was bound to happen sooner or\n\
         later. The enticing-looking teleporter that\n\
         promised to take you straight to the alien\n\
         fortress turned out to be a primitive trap.\n\
         Your fault for not double-checking the\n\
         destination in all the excitement!\n\
         Wherever you now are, you've been thrown\n\
         into a cramped cage and left there, for now.\n\
         The caged alien bugs all around you seem\n\
         excited by this - forgetting about their\n\
         own situation and making all sorts of\n\
         taunting noises and gestures at you. It's\n\
         clear they all know you. And they hate you.\n\
         But never mind that - escape is the goal.\n\
         You wait until the bugs are asleep, then\n\
         start looking for a way to open the cage.\n\
         And quietly. Any noise now means death!
# Before MAP32 (secret level #2):
C6TEXT = Two portals to choose from - one of them\n\
         was the one you arrived through, but you\n\
         forgot which was which!! And you chose...\n\
         Poorly. This must be where they intended\n\
         to throw you in later, because you found\n\
         yourself right in the middle of an arena.\n\
         So primitive. Suits these guys, heh.\n\
         You look at the sky above you - well,\n\
         doesn't look like Earth. But as you\n\
         make up another plan to get out of here,\n\
         you're interrupted by the first wave of\n\
         gladiators arriving.\n\n\
         Well then! If it's bloodsports they want,\n\
         It's bloodsports they get! Just don't\n\
         complain if there's too much blood, idiots!
