These are stopgap endgame screens created from screenshots of the last
levels of each episode.

VICTORY2: screenshot from E2M8 showing killed boss monster. I took this
screenshot with the full brightness cheat on and "artificially"
darkened it afterwards.

PFUB1/2: screenshot from E3M8 showing killed boss monster. I took this
in PrBoom+ at 640x480, then cropped it down into two 320x200 images
that seamlessly scroll together. The marine sprite was added in
afterwards.

ENDPIC: screenshot from E4M8 showing killed boss monsters.

All screenshots were taken with the game running in 640x480, and were
resized to 640x400 to take into account Doom's aspect ratio issues.
