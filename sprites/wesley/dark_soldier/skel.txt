  Refurbish of existing black revenant.  Reduced in height to fit
  engine size of 56 pixels.  Fixed proportions of revenant, and

  FreeDoom sprites.
  This has a unique set of sprites, so cannot use old wadinfo.txt.

    skel.txt		this file
    /sprites  		directory of all ppm files
    wadinfo.txt 	deutex wadinfo, for only the spid sprites

- Description:
  Black Revenant with white claws, with missile launcher on chain around neck.
  Has missiles on waist.
  Claw attack.
