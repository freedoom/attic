Hello Fraggle,

Here's another contribution of me to FREEDOOM.

I have included in this zip three sprites for the FREEDOOM
project, that replace the Flaming Barrel sprites. These are
my first sprites :), so please tell me what you think of it.
I used as base the existing FREEDOOM barrel sprite in 
combination with the existing FREEDOOM Arch-Vile fire sprite.
I have (again) intentionally chosen a easy one, so that it 
would not be difficult to re-make it :) Good luck with your
project :).
