Creature Action Sounds for Freedoom - G. Wessner "Stilgar"
				 (masterstilgar@yahoo.com)

Sound effects recorded by myself via microphone and audio
manipulation software.  I hereby allow the Freedoom project to
use these audio files under the Freedoom license.

DSBGACT and DSDMACT are the main additions in this .zip.  DSBGACT
is a hiss type sound, to go with the snake-imp, while DSDMACT is
a "generic" growl, since it is used by a variety of creatures.

spare_death.wav is an extra.  I recorded it intending to make a
player death sound for "DSPDIEHI", but after testing I don't think
it fits that slot very well.  I'm including it anyways since I don't
think it is a bad sound in its own right. If it is deemed useful
somewhere, please do slot it in, otherwise feel free to make it
available on the "attic" area.
