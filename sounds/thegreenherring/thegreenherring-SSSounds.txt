DSSSSIT.WAV
DSSSDTH.WAV

These are sound replacements for the Wolfenstein SS that I recorded on the day I
got myself a new headset (March 31, 2008.)  Both of them are voiceovers in
Spanish; DSSSSIT.WAV is "¡Alto!" ("Halt!") while DSSSDTH.WAV is "¡Mierda!"
("Shit!").  Hope these are worthy (and possibly comical) enough to include in
the IWAD!
