Jon!

Here is the sound that I created for Freedoom. You can use it as you
wish, though I recommend it for a monster alert sound, or a romero
death. :)

NOTE: this sound does not conform to the 8-bit, 22050 kHz doom sound
standard. If this is a problem, let me know and I'll fix it, but the
sound may be hampered due to the frequencies the sound uses. If you can
fix it, that'd be even better. :P

you can credit me as CSonicGo, but don't print my email address.

Thanks!
