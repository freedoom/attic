I've taken the liberty to edit the imp sounds and the lost soul attack sound
in order to increase their volume so that they are actually hearable during
normal play.  I noticed that they are nearly impossible to hear while playing,
due to the fact that they are so soft that other noises such as the guns and
monsters completely cover the imp and lost soul sounds.  Of course, I did not
create the original sounds, and so do not take credit for them, I just altered
them so that they could be heard better.
