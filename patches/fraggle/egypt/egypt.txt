Egypt textures.

These are remakes of the textures that tnt.wad included these for its
Egyptian-themed MAP31 secret level. The base is nb_nmare's rw23_3
patch, recolored to a brighter shade of yellow - this can be seen in
STWALL. This was then altered into a "plain" (no bricks) version for the
murals.

The mural images come from "EGYPTIAN IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE" by
E.A. Wallis Budge, pubished 1908 and found on Project Gutenberg. Due
to its age its copyright has expired; the original murals are ancient
so no copyright on those, either. Two of the larger images from the
book were cut up to make the various images found here.
